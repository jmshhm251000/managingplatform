# ManagingPlatform

## Overview

ManagingPlatform is a Flask-based web application integrating Instagram APIs with a chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using the `llama_index` and `Ollama` framework. The app supports secure user login, message history analytics, and knowledge base management with NLP features.

---

## Features

- User authentication with OAuth integration  
- Access and display Instagram insights and messaging analytics  
- MongoDB backend for storing chat history and user data  
- Chatbot implementation with LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- API routes modularized under `/api` namespace  
- Docker support for containerized deployment  

---

## TODO

- Refactor `db.py` and `webhooks.py` to use **MongoDB Atlas (cloud)** instead of local MongoDB
  - Update database connection strings to MongoDB Atlas URI
  - Configure authentication and connection pooling for Atlas
  - Test database operations with cloud DB

- Modularize API routes following the **single-responsibility principle**
  - The current `/dashboard` API endpoint combines multiple distinct features in a single function:
    - Fetching Facebook Pages linked to the user  
    - Extracting Instagram Business Account IDs from those pages  
    - Fetching Instagram insights for the selected Instagram account  
    - Rendering the dashboard with combined data  

  - This tightly couples different concerns, making the code harder to maintain, test, and extend.

  - To improve, break down this monolithic endpoint into smaller, single-purpose APIs or helper functions, for example:
    - One API/function to fetch and return Facebook Pages linked to the user  
    - One API/function to extract and return Instagram Business Account IDs from a given page  
    - One API/function to fetch Instagram insights data for a given Instagram Business Account ID  
    - One API to assemble these smaller calls or serve the dashboard view  

  - Organize these logically using Flask Blueprints or modules, so each API endpoint or function focuses on a single responsibility.

- Improve **error handling and logging** in all API modules
  - Add detailed error messages for MongoDB Atlas connection issues
  - Log webhook requests and responses with identifiers for tracing
  - Implement retry logic on transient database failures

- Enhance **security** for cloud deployment
  - Secure environment variables and database credentials
  - Add rate limiting and authentication on critical endpoints if missing
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs

- Update **documentation**
  - Reflect MongoDB Atlas changes and new API structure in README and code comments
  - Document required environment variables explicitly
  - Provide example usage for each new API endpoint

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later  
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)  
- Access to Google and Meta APIs with appropriate credentials  
- Docker (optional, for container deployment)
